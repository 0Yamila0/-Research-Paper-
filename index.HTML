      <h2> The Complex Number Calculator </h2>
    </div>
    <p> The Complex Number Calculator was capable of using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to calculate complex numbers. <br> The Complex Number Calculator was fast compared to other calculators of that time. <br> The calculator
      could display two eight digit place number equations in about less than thirty seconds. It could performed such calculations using a teletype terminal connected via the New York over telephone lines.<br> The calculator was the first to show
      examples of remote access computing , which would later in turn be one of many calculators that would become the foundation of digital computers.<br> This was all possible thanks to <em> George Stibitz</em>. He was a born in Pennsylvania and in
      Bells Lab he created this magnificent calculator. He started the process of creating the calculator in 1937. He, with the help of others, finished the calculator in 1939. <br> But the calculator was not shown to the general public until 1940 in
      an American Mathematical Society conference.

      <h2> Direct keyboard input to computer </h2>
    </div>
    <p class=""> Around the mid-twentieth century, researchers began to fool around with direct keyboard input to computers which is a predecessor for today’s mode of conduct. <br> Before this became a thing,
      many computer users would install programs into those computer by punched cards or paper tape . A totally different and strange way to install or fed programs, isn’t it? <br> Doug Ross is the one who experimented with a memo of having a direct
      keyboard input would be faster and easier for daily computer users. <br> He proved his memo right when he connected a keyboard to MIT’s Whirlwind computer. This computer was ahead of it’s time when computer users could only fed programs to computers
      through tape and cards.<br> The Whirlwind would later on help with computers memory which would be core memory. A fun fact about the creation of the direct keyboard input to computers is that the invention was created on July, 4. </p>

      <h2> Computer Space </h2>
    </div>
    <p> In 1971 Computer space was released and the public received it with a shock expression.<br> Computer Space pitted a player-controlled rocket ship against two machine-controlled flying saucers in a space simulation set before a two-dimensional
      star field.<br> It was created by Nolan Bushnell with the help of Nutting Associates and Ted Dabney who were all business partners. This game was the first mast produced and commercially sold video game....ever....like the first ever.<br> This video
      game was a game changer to video games and console history. In video game because the general public have never, at that time period, seen anything like that concept in their life, so it was something they considered ‘foreign’ and ‘new’.<br>
      Computer Space made waves in the video game console industry, because of what it was played. It was a tall looking TV stand, basically their first attempt of what we call today ‘arcade machines’. </p>



    <div class="mainp">
      <h2> IBM Microdrive </h2>
    </div>
    <p>What is Microdrive, you may ask? Well it was basically their modern day hard drive. At that time, before the Microdrive was invented, hard drive were big and hard to carry around with.<br> But with the introduction of the Microdrive, created and
      released by IBM, which were the smallest hard drives in the world when introduced to the genral public.<br> Microdrive were small and hard drives that were very fragile things, compared to hard drives today. If it became too hot, it wouldn’t work
      anymore, if it got bumped against something small, again they wouldn’t work.<br> When they were introduced, they had the capacities of either 170MB or 340 MB, which was more than CompactFlash and other leading hard drives in the market, and they
      stayed like that for a couple of years.<br> Later they released a second generation of Micrdrives, this time with capacities of 512MB or 1GB, this would later become their ‘standard version’. </p>

  <div class="mainp">
    <h2> CompactFlash </h2>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>The CompactFlash was the hard drive to beat, what seemed unbeatable at the time, IBM’s Micrdrive.<br> 3 young people worked together with the goal of developing and selling solid state storage products with no moving parts that could hold data for
      years with no power applied to it. <br> Flash memory was a technology that people knew could exist, but just didn’t know how or why it could exist. And Eli Harari, the leader of the group, was the one who saw huge protentional in Flash Memory. <br> And
      once the CompactFlash was released, it was a major success! It beat IBM’s Microdrive, and became the industries true industry standard.<br> Because CompactFlash became a standard, everybody made CompactFlashes, and the slots from phones, camera’s,
      and TV sets were made specifically for CompactFlash. <br> And after that millions upon millions of CompactFlashes have been sold even til this day! Of course it can’t beat the newly, created flash drive, but it is still an available choice for
      drives and still being sold today! </p>
