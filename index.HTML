    <h2> The Complex Number Calculator </h2>
      </div>
        <p> The Complex Number Calculator was capable of using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to calculate complex numbers. <br> The Complex Number Calculator was fast compared to other calculators of that time. <br>  The calculator could display two eight digit place number equations in about less than thirty seconds. It could performed such calculations using a teletype terminal connected via the New York over telephone lines.<br>  The calculator was the first to show examples of remote access computing , which would later in turn be one of many calculators that would become the foundation of digital computers.<br> This was all possible thanks to <em> George Stibitz</em>. He was a born in Pennsylvania and in Bells Lab he created this magnificent calculator. He started the process of creating the calculator in 1937. He, with the help of others, finished the calculator in 1939. <br> But the calculator was not shown to the general public until 1940 in an American Mathematical Society conference.
